## **Business Activities**

<!-- Who is the company's intended customer? -->
*  Their products are intended for enterprises, institutions, and individual investors.
<!-- Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? -->
*   U.S. crypto exchanges made an estimated *$1 billion* in trade fee revenue in 2019. [4]  As the price of cryptocurrency increases the percentage based fee follows suit and allows for these type of companies to earn more with no additional effort.
<!-- What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? -->

Paxos is *subject to a higher level of regulatory oversight, providing customers the trust that there funds are held securely*.

<!-- Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? -->
*  They are using private blockchain to settle public securities and provide stablecoin as a service on public blockchain.  

## **Landscape**
<!-- What domain of the financial industry is the company in? -->
* They cover several domains of the financial industry to include Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, Enterprise Solutions, and Institutional Solutions.

<!-- What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? -->
* The major trends in these domains are a new class of cryptocurrencies that offer price stability via collateralization.  Decentralized exchanges (DEX) which allows for direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediates.  Bitcoin Lightning Network for instant transactions without creating a on-blockchain transaction for individual payments.  *Homomorphic encryption allows for computation of data without decrypting*. [6]  (In the healthcare field can resolve medical data privacy issues.)

<!-- What are the other major companies in this domain? -->
* Other major companies in the stablecoin domain are Tether Operations Limited (USDT) *$34.8B*, Circle International Bermuda (USDC) *$8.1B*, Maker Foundation (DAI) *$2.3B*, and Binance (BUSD) *$2.2B*. [5]

## **Results**
<!-- What has been the business impact of this company so far? -->
* Paxos blockchain-based settlement services is being used by large banks like Credit Suisse, Société Générale, and Instinet.  They are a major player in the stablecoin market and rank 5th.  Paypal will use Paxos Crypto Brokerage API to integrate cryptocurreny into the Paypal digital wallet.

<!-- What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? -->
* Some of the metrics that can be used to compare the stablecoin solution with others is Market Capitalization, Market Dominance, and Trading Volume.

<!-- How is your company performing, based on these metrics? -->
* We are able to evaluate company performance by comparing there USD stablecoin PAX and Gold-backed stablecoin PAXG to other similar products.   There impact in the PAX stablecoin Based on Market Cap shows that they are not growing at the same rate as competitors but are increasing there market cap at a steady rate.  Market Dominance dropped from 4% to under 2% year over year due to USDT growth/popularity also the addition of new stablecoins .  Trading volume has decreased significantly (80-90% decrease) perhaps due to expiration of promotions during 2020. [5]  In the gold-backed stablecoin they presently trade the most and are 2nd in market cap to new Tether Gold-backed token XAUT.

<!-- How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? -->
* Currently they are not growing as fast, but I anticipate business will pick up considerably once Paypal users can purchase native blockchain tokens powered by Paxos.

## **Recommendations**
<!-- If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? -->
* Create the paxos decentralized blockchain to offer faster transaction times and a lower fees.  (Should not depend on other Blockchains)

* Lauch an iOS and Android smartphone app so users can exchange tokens on the go and manage account activity.

* Add securities/equities to their exchange so they are traded side by side to native cryptocurrency.  Allow for native cryptocurrency to stock purchases.

* Reduce fees to help increase liquidity/volume on exchange. (Cryptocurrency Withdrawls Fees and ACH Fees)

<!-- Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? -->
* By offering these recommendations they will create new revenue and increase transaction count on there platform.  They are a fee-based company and more volume would translate to increased profit.

<!-- What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? -->
* They would need to reuse an existing blockchain source code or create there own.  At the same time decide on a consensus mechanism.   They would require mobile app developers to maintain and continuosly develop the app.

<!-- Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? -->
* *The blockchain technology is appropriate because it is safer way of storing records and maintaining a history.   It is a database that stores data in blocks that are chained together.  Decentralized blockchains are immutable and data written to it is irreversible.* [8]
