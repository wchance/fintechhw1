Bitcoin Lightning Network for instant transactions without creating a on-blockchain transaction for individual payments.  **Homomorphic encryption allows for computation of data without decrypting**. [6]  (In the healthcare field can resolve medical data privacy issues.)

* Comparing the stablecoin they use Market Capitalization, Market Dominance, and Trading Volume.

<!-- How is your company performing, based on these metrics? -->
* Based on Market Cap they are not growing at the same rate as competitors but are increasing at a steady rate.  Market Dominance dropped from 4% to under 2% year over year.  Trading volume has decreased significantly (80-90% decrease). [5]

<!-- How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? -->
* Currently they are not growing as fast, but I anticipate business will pick up considerably once Paypal users can purchase native blockchain tokens powered by Paxos.

## **Recommendations**

&nbsp;

<!-- If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? -->
* Add securities to their exchange solution itBit so they can be traded side by side to native cryptocurrency.

<!-- Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? -->
* They are a fee-based company, and this would create new revenue from increased transactions and spike in new customers.

<!-- What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? -->
* Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and Homomorphic encryption.

<!-- Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? -->
* Because public blockchains allows for all data to be freely accessible, smart contracts allow for execution of trade to be tied to events, and homomorphic encryption will allow for computation to be performed on encrypted data without exposing critical information about the transaction.
